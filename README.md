# WallpaperEngine-Spotify-App
# A Application you can host on a computer to get your most reacently played song from spotify using the API.

# To set up please use a spotify developer account and use 'http://localhost:5500/index.html' as a callback uri.
# Also use 'tokens.js' as a token file so you can use your own client_ID and client_SECRET.

# This can be set up using the Windows IIS however the callback uri will need editing so the api will call back to your IP.
